+ sibpair simulation
	. 2 sibs: one affected and the other unaffected
	. permutation test: permute the case control status within the pair, not across studies
	. test: MZ chisq statistic (cannot use CMC???)
	. extention: WSS or VT
	. implement "markwildSibpairloci": to focus on variant sites which are
	discordant among the sibs
